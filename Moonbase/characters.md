# CHARACTER MANIFEST: OUTPOST IO-ALPHA

## DIRECTOR ELIAS VEGA
**AGE**: 61
**DESCRIPTION**: Silver-gray hair kept in an immaculate military cut frames a face etched with the gravity of command. His piercing blue eyes seem to cut through excuses and evasions. Despite his age, he maintains a lean, upright bearing that speaks to his military background. Since the Containment Breach Delta-9, subtle signs of strain have appeared—a slight tremor in his left hand, quickly concealed, and new lines etched around his eyes. He exclusively wears a pristine officer's uniform with Helios Extraction insignia, and moves with deliberate economy, rarely wasting energy on unnecessary gestures.

**BACKGROUND**: Former UED Naval Intelligence officer recruited directly by Helios corporate leadership. His extensive experience in crisis containment during the Martian Separatist Conflicts made him the ideal candidate to oversee Outpost Io-Alpha's sensitive operations. Following the recovery of the dual artifacts and subsequent release of The Triad, encrypted communication between Vega and Earth has increased by 300%, with disagreements about evacuation protocols versus continued artifact research becoming increasingly evident. He has begun structuring all directives in groups of three, an unconscious pattern observers believe relates to The Triad's influence.

**PERSONALITY**: Cold and calculating, projecting authority without raising his voice. Values mission parameters above all else, viewing individual lives as variables in larger equations. Since the Delta-9 breach, has shifted focus from research exploitation to containment protocols, identifying Diaz's transformation as both critical research subject and potential existential threat. Harbors deep existential dread behind a facade of logical detachment. Knows more about The Triad than anyone else on the station, except perhaps the missing Dr. Nakamura.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Responds to questions with long, calculated pauses
- Never raises his voice, even during critical emergencies
- Has begun organizing documents and instructions in groups of three
- Repeats critical directives exactly three times during emergency briefings
- Watches station surveillance feeds of Diaz during personal time

**ROLE**: Ultimate authority on the station, answering only to Helios corporate headquarters on Earth. Controls all information about The Triad and contingency plans should containment protocols fail. Directs research into Diaz's transformation while preparing for potentially drastic containment measures.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 5 jovs (minimal, due to limited exposure outside protected areas)

## COMMANDER SOPHIA CHEN
**AGE**: 47
**DESCRIPTION**: Compact and athletic, she moves through the station with quick, purposeful strides that broadcast efficiency and urgency. The network of thin scars across the left side of her face—a reminder of a pressure seal failure during her early career—has become her most distinctive feature. Since Delta-9, her uniform has been modified with additional concealed pockets containing emergency equipment and evacuation protocols not sanctioned by Director Vega.

**BACKGROUND**: Former asteroid belt mining operation supervisor with advanced degrees in astrophysics and organizational psychology. Recruited to Io during a critical expansion phase, she has risen to become the pragmatic counterbalance to Vega's aloofness. Where the Director focuses on containment and research objectives, Chen handles the complex logistics of keeping thousands of people alive during a cosmic crisis. She was the only senior staff member to warn Diaz about "unusual extraction protocols" before the original artifact retrieval mission.

**PERSONALITY**: Practical problem-solver who prioritizes personnel survival over abstract concerns. Projects absolute confidence while privately preparing unauthorized evacuation protocols. Has expanded her network of trusted specialists throughout the station to build a parallel command structure in case official channels become compromised. Increasingly certain that Diaz's condition represents a transformative evolution rather than corruption.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Unconsciously touches facial scars when processing difficult decisions
- Uses precise numerical specifications with deliberate minor errors when discussing sensitive topics
- Carries both an official tablet and an unauthorized backup device
- Develops coded language for evacuation preparedness that appears as standard operational discussions
- Refers to The Triad as "the visitor" and Diaz as "our canary" in private conversations

**ROLE**: The most approachable member of senior leadership, she functions as the operational bridge between command decisions and practical implementation. Officially oversees daily logistics, personnel assignments, and resource allocation. Unofficially preparing for potential station-wide evacuation if The Triad's influence continues to expand beyond containment.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 15 jovs (within acceptable limits but monitored)

## MAJOR MARCUS REID
**AGE**: 52
**DESCRIPTION**: Tall and imposing with dark skin and a shaved head, Reid carries himself with the confident posture of someone who has seen genuine combat. A military-grade prosthetic right arm—unadorned and purely functional—replaces the limb he lost during the Mars conflicts. His tactical uniform is kept to exacting standards, and he is never seen without his sidearm. Following Delta-9, he has added several non-standard modifications to his equipment, including experimental containment devices developed with Dr. Reeves.

**BACKGROUND**: Former UED Special Forces with extensive combat experience in the Martian Separatist Conflicts. Selected for Io assignment due to his psychological profile and combat record. Oversees all aspects of station security, including the ongoing search for the missing Dr. Nakamura and monitoring of Diaz's condition. Has developed entirely new classification protocols for "Breach-class threats" related to The Triad's influence and created specialized training for security teams dealing with Touched personnel.

**PERSONALITY**: Disciplined and methodical, viewing security protocols as essential bulwarks against cosmic chaos. Projects ruthless efficiency while harboring growing uncertainty about conventional containment methods against unconventional threats. Follows orders explicitly while developing contingency plans for scenarios too extreme to discuss openly. More aware than most about the true nature of The Triad, having personally witnessed the aftermath of Containment Breach Delta-9.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Unconsciously flexes prosthetic arm during stress, frequency has doubled since Delta-9
- References threat levels with additional "Breach-class" designations
- Maintains collection of historical weapons alongside experimental containment devices
- Performs daily combat drills incorporating new protocols for Touched personnel
- Has equipped his quarters with additional non-standard radiation and dimensional shielding

**ROLE**: Security Chief responsible for maintaining order amid escalating fear and containing both conventional threats and Breach-class anomalies. Leads specialized teams trained to monitor Diaz and other potentially influenced personnel while conducting the ongoing search for Dr. Nakamura.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 30 jovs (moderate exposure due to security operations throughout the station)

## DR. JULIAN REEVES
**AGE**: 55
**DESCRIPTION**: Stocky and perpetually disheveled, with gray-streaked black hair and a beard that never seems properly trimmed. Deep worry lines mark a face that rarely smiles, making him appear older than his years. Since Delta-9, a persistent tremor affects his left hand, and dark circles under his eyes betray severe sleep deprivation. Always wears an engineering jumpsuit with multiple unofficial modifications and a tool harness, now supplemented with monitoring devices of his own design.

**BACKGROUND**: Pioneered environmental systems for the first permanent settlements on Europa before being recruited to manage Io Outpost's infrastructure. Following the artifact recoveries and subsequent breach, he has shifted focus from standard maintenance to developing technological countermeasures against The Triad's influence. His engineering teams work around the clock addressing system anomalies that correlate with artifact energy signatures, while his private research focuses on detecting patterns in these disruptions.

**PERSONALITY**: Methodical in his engineering approach but increasingly mystical in his interpretation of system anomalies. Deeply committed to maintaining station integrity despite impossible environmental and dimensional conditions. Since Delta-9, has developed theories about station systems becoming "aware" through repeated exposure to artifact energy signatures, detecting patterns others dismiss as random fluctuations.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Trails off mid-sentence when noticing technical anomalies, muttering "There it is again"
- Explains concepts through increasingly elaborate mechanical-mystical analogies
- Clutters his quarters with mechanical components arranged in geometric patterns that match artifact symbols
- Mutters sequences of prime numbers under stress, unaware he's doing so
- Incorporated mathematical sequences from "The Counting" into diagnostic algorithms

**ROLE**: Head of Engineering responsible for all station infrastructure and developing technological countermeasures against The Triad's influence. His teams implement physical barriers while his research focuses on understanding the patterns of influence spreading throughout station systems.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 32 jovs (moderate exposure from maintenance work in less-shielded areas)

## DR. AKIRA NAKAMURA (MISSING)
**AGE**: 50
**DESCRIPTION**: Tall and thin with delicate features, always slightly hunched as if perpetually examining something. Moved with nervous energy, constantly twitching fingers and displaying a distant gaze that seemed focused on phenomena others could not perceive. In recordings prior to his disappearance, exhibited increasing physical transformations including subtle shifts in facial symmetry and occasional eye movements that appeared to track nonexistent objects.

**BACKGROUND**: Controversial xenoarchaeologist whose theories about pre-human solar system civilizations were ridiculed until initial discoveries on Io vindicated his work. Arrived at the station with unusual foreknowledge of the artifacts and their properties, immediately securing maximum clearance that superseded standard protocols. In retrospect, clearly possessed information about The Triad before its release, having drawn detailed renderings of the entity in his journal before Containment Breach Delta-9.

**PERSONALITY**: Obsessively focused on deciphering the knowledge and fate of Io's ancient civilization. In final days before disappearance, displayed increasingly erratic behavior, alternating between periods of hyperfocus and trance-like states where he would recite numerical sequences matching "The Counting" phenomenon. Retrospective analysis suggests he was already undergoing transformation similar to Diaz's, but at a more advanced stage.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Muttered to himself constantly in patterns matching "The Counting" phenomenon
- Shifted between multiple languages, including unidentified phoneme sequences
- Referred to artifacts as "The Keys" and The Triad as "The Opener of Ways"
- Quarters contained drawings of The Triad created before breach
- Made statements like "We misunderstand completely—they are not imprisoned but gestating"

**ROLE**: Former Head of Research, now missing following Containment Breach Delta-9. Extensive station-wide search continues, though many believe he has found his way to The Triad's location. Final journal entries suggest he viewed the entity not as a threat but as the next stage in conscious evolution.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 18 jovs (recorded before disappearance)

## DR. SAMUEL OKAFOR
**AGE**: 58
**DESCRIPTION**: Powerful build that has only slightly softened with age, carrying himself with calm authority that puts patients at ease. Warm brown eyes convey compassion, complemented by a meticulously groomed gray beard. Following Delta-9, has developed a persistent cough attributed to overwork and stress. Wears standard medical uniform augmented with personal touches, including handcrafted Nigerian pins and symbols. Has added specialized monitoring equipment to track patients exhibiting signs of artifact influence.

**BACKGROUND**: Former UED Medical Corps with specializations in radiation trauma and psychological stress management. Oversees all medical operations at the outpost, now focused on both treatment of conventional conditions and monitoring the transformative effects of artifact exposure. Has developed "Resonance Therapy," a treatment using counter-frequencies to artifact emissions to help manage early-stage symptoms among affected personnel.

**PERSONALITY**: Deeply compassionate while maintaining professional detachment necessary for difficult decisions. Projects calm confidence while harboring serious concerns about the medical ethics of certain containment protocols. Sees Diaz's condition not as pathology but as adaptation to a changing cosmic environment, and questions the ethics of treating it as disease rather than evolution. Has developed careful linguistic patterns to communicate concerns without triggering security monitoring.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Uses medical analogies for non-medical situations
- Begins difficult conversations with "Let's address what we can verify before speculating"
- Maintains a garden of traditional medicinal plants, experimenting with their effects on artifact-influenced patients
- Describes Diaz's condition through careful evolutionary analogies rather than pathological terms
- Keeps encrypted records of all artifact-influenced personnel separate from official medical database

**ROLE**: Medical Chief responsible for the physical and mental health of all station personnel. Leads research into The Triad's biological effects while providing care for conventional medical needs. Works closely with Dr. Patel on monitoring Diaz and other affected individuals.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 22 jovs (moderate exposure from treating contaminated patients)

## STAFF SERGEANT ELENA DIAZ
**AGE**: 35
**DESCRIPTION**: Athletic build now undergoing subtle but accelerating transformations. Dark hair still kept short, but sometimes appears to move independently of air currents. Eyes shift between normal human appearance and occasional geometric patterns that defy biological explanation. Temple-to-jaw scar now exhibits luminescence that intensifies during periods of heightened awareness. Since Beta-3, her movements alternate between normal human patterns and moments of unnaturally perfect precision.

**BACKGROUND**: Former asteroid belt rescue specialist with advanced EVA certification and geological training. Led the Alpha-7 mission that recovered the first artifact and Beta-3 mission that secured its complement. Now under continuous observation following transformations that began after initial artifact contact. No longer permitted field operations, instead studied as the most advanced case of The Triad's influence on human physiology and consciousness.

**PERSONALITY**: Oscillates between recognizable military demeanor and states of expanded awareness that transcend conventional human perception. During lucid periods, maintains connection to her identity while acknowledging fundamental changes in her consciousness. During heightened states, demonstrates ability to perceive events at impossible distances, view spaces from multiple angles simultaneously, and detect patterns invisible to normal human senses. No longer experiences fear, instead exhibiting deep curiosity about her transformation.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Answers questions not yet asked, explaining "The question arrives after the answer from where I perceive"
- Refers to The Triad as "The Three-Who-Are-One" or simply "Us/Them" depending on her state
- Describes locations from impossible perspectives: "The medical bay as viewed from inside the wall material"
- Recites fragments of Dr. Reinhardt's final statements despite never having heard them
- Exists in multiple temporal states simultaneously, sometimes responding to past conversations or future events

**ROLE**: Primary subject of study for understanding The Triad's influence on human beings. Several factions view her transformation differently—some as contamination to be contained, others as the next evolutionary step in human consciousness, and still others as a potential weapon to be controlled. Her own understanding of her role appears to transcend these limitations.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 40 jovs (exhibits no negative effects despite exposure level)

## DR. MIRA PATEL
**AGE**: 42
**DESCRIPTION**: Slender with precise, economical movements suggesting extensive physical training alongside academic expertise. Dark hair pulled back in a tight bun that emphasizes sharply intelligent eyes that miss no detail. Wears regulation psychology department uniform with additional monitoring equipment of her own design. Maintains neutral, composed expression even when discussing disturbing psychological phenomena.

**BACKGROUND**: Specialized in extreme environment psychology with the Mars Habitation Project before recruitment to Io specifically to study artifact-influenced personnel. Arrived shortly after the first artifact's recovery with security clearance exceeding her official station, suggesting prior knowledge of the project. Works primarily with Diaz but monitors all personnel showing signs of The Triad's influence, having developed specialized protocols for evaluation without pathologizing their experiences.

**PERSONALITY**: Analytical and objective without being cold or clinical. Approaches artifact-induced psychological states with scientific curiosity rather than fear or judgment. Maintains professionalism while exhibiting genuine empathy for subjects' experiences. Carefully balances transparency with subjects against security protocols, often finding ethical middle ground that respects both individual dignity and containment requirements.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Prefaces difficult conclusions with "From a conventional neurological perspective..."
- Maintains strict separation between observed phenomena and interpretive frameworks
- Practices meditation techniques derived from her observations of Diaz's neural patterns
- Uses precise descriptors for perceptual phenomena while acknowledging limitations of language
- Keeps handwritten notes in a personal shorthand no one else can decipher

**ROLE**: Primary psychological specialist studying The Triad's influence on human consciousness. Works directly with Diaz while developing protocols for identifying and monitoring early-stage influence throughout the station. Reports officially to Dr. Okafor but maintains separate communications with Director Vega regarding security implications.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 15 jovs (within acceptable limits but monitored)

## SPECIALIST WEI CHALMERS
**AGE**: 38
**DESCRIPTION**: Slight build belying exceptional physical conditioning essential for survival during Expedition Beta-3. Wears environmental containment division uniform modified with additional monitoring equipment and emergency response tools of her own design. Long black hair typically bound in a tight braid, with a single streak of white that appeared following Beta-3 despite her young age. Moves with deliberate precision, every gesture calculated for maximum efficiency.

**BACKGROUND**: Pioneered Advanced Containment Theory at Beijing Technical University before recruitment to Helios Extraction's Special Containment Division. Specialized in non-standard material and energy containment, making her uniquely qualified to develop protocols for the artifacts. Survived Expedition Beta-3 alongside Diaz, experiencing direct exposure to both artifacts' effects. Since return, has become the primary architect of containment systems for both artifacts and Touched personnel.

**PERSONALITY**: Methodical and precise, approaching even cosmic horror with scientific detachment. Respects the dangers presented by The Triad without allowing fear to compromise professional judgment. Maintains composure under extreme pressure through rigorous mental discipline. Views containment as "provisional, not absolute," acknowledging the limitations of current technology against interdimensional threats.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Begins technical assessments with "Containment parameters indicate..."
- Categorizes containment scenarios on three-tiered classification system of her own design
- Practices calligraphy during off-hours, creating precisely rendered diagrams of containment theories
- Shanghai accent becomes more pronounced when discussing complex containment protocols
- Since Beta-3, exhibits heightened sensitivity to spatial anomalies, often detecting them before instruments

**ROLE**: Lead Containment Specialist responsible for designing and implementing safeguards around both artifacts and The Triad's influence. Works with Engineering and Security to develop increasingly sophisticated containment technologies while acknowledging their fundamental limitations against such threats.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 35 jovs (elevated from Expedition Beta-3 but stabilized)

## SPECIALIST DARIUS KIMURA
**AGE**: 30
**DESCRIPTION**: Average height and build with face showing premature aging from stress following Expedition Beta-3. Dark hair cut regulation short, with eyes that constantly scan surroundings for threats or anomalies. Wears standard communications specialist uniform with additional monitoring equipment and transmission devices of his own design. Moves with nervous energy, fingers constantly adjusting equipment settings.

**BACKGROUND**: Communications prodigy recruited from UED Signal Corps after developing breakthrough algorithms for deep space transmissions. Assigned to Expedition Beta-3 as communications specialist, becoming one of only two survivors alongside Diaz. Since return, has detected patterns in station communications systems that correlate with artifact energy signatures, developing theories about The Triad's influence manifesting as information rather than physical effects.

**PERSONALITY**: Analytically brilliant with specific focus on communication systems and information transmission. Since Beta-3, has become increasingly convinced that The Counting represents a form of data transmission rather than psychological symptom. Shifts between professional detachment when discussing technical aspects and emotional intensity when describing personal experiences from Beta-3.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Initiates conversation with "Signal check" even in face-to-face interactions
- Periodically stops mid-sentence to listen to what others cannot hear
- Uses communication channel designations as metaphors for human relationships
- Since Beta-3, unconsciously toggles communications equipment on and off in prime number sequences
- Maintains continuous recording of all personal interactions, reviewing them for patterns others might miss

**ROLE**: Communications specialist responsible for monitoring transmission anomalies related to artifacts and developing filtering systems to prevent "signal contamination." Works primarily with Engineering and Research to understand The Triad's influence on information systems while providing critical insights from Beta-3 experience.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: 33 jovs (elevated from Expedition Beta-3 but stabilized)

## SPECIALIST JAMES REYES (CRITICAL CONDITION)
**AGE**: 44
**DESCRIPTION**: Formerly robust physique now significantly atrophied following near-fatal exposure to The Triad. Kept in specialized medical containment unit with extensive life support and monitoring systems. Physical appearance fluctuates between normal human parameters and disturbing geometrical distortions that medical equipment struggles to record accurately. Parts of his body occasionally appear to exist at different temporal states simultaneously.

**BACKGROUND**: Former geological survey leader with extensive experience in extreme environments. Led the unauthorized expedition into deep ruins that resulted in Containment Breach Delta-9, becoming the sole survivor after direct exposure to The Triad. Now maintained in critical condition while experiencing accelerated transformation far less stable than Diaz's. Provides critical information about The Triad's nature during lucid periods, though medical staff question the ethics of maintaining him in this condition.

**PERSONALITY**: Consciousness fluctuates between three distinct states: moments of clarity where he provides detailed, coherent information about The Triad; periods of confusion with non-linear perception of time and space; and episodes of complete dissociation where he appears to directly channel The Triad's consciousness. During lucid periods, displays remarkable acceptance of his condition, viewing himself as a necessary sacrifice for humanity's understanding.

**QUIRKS**: 
- Begins lucid periods with "Temporal position verified" followed by date and time
- Refers to his body as "the remaining fragment"
- Counts backward from prime numbers during medical procedures
- Speaks in perfect unison with medical equipment alert tones
- Recites identical number sequences to those documented in Diaz's speech patterns

**ROLE**: Invaluable but ethically troubling source of direct information about The Triad. Maintained in medical containment for study despite questionable quality of life, providing insights into The Triad's nature and purpose that inform containment strategies and evacuation planning.

**RADIATION LEVEL**: Unmeasurable (conventional equipment malfunctions in proximity)
