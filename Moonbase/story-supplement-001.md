# MISSION REPORT: ARTIFACT RETRIEVAL EXPEDITION ALPHA-7

## Executive Summary

This document chronicles the events of Expedition Alpha-7, the third major xenoarchaeological mission into the ruins discovered beneath Io's surface, led by Staff Sergeant Elena Diaz. The mission resulted in the recovery of a significant non-Euclidean artifact of unknown purpose, at the cost of seven team members. This continues Staff Sergeant Diaz's unusual pattern of being the sole or primary survivor of high-casualty missions, raising questions about the selection criteria demonstrated by the ruins' defense mechanisms.

## Mission Timeline

### Pre-Mission Events

Following the discovery of alien ruins during a routine geological survey, two previous expeditions established the existence of a non-human civilization that occupied Io approximately 50 million years ago. The second expedition, led by Staff Sergeant Diaz, penetrated deeper into the structure and discovered evidence pointing to a "containment vault" housing an artifact of extraordinary significance. Despite losing six team members, Diaz returned with data that allowed Dr. Nakamura's research team to identify the artifact's chamber.

Director Vega ordered Expedition Alpha-7 after receiving encrypted communications directly from Earth corporate headquarters—unusual protocol suggesting the mission carried significance beyond standard operational parameters. Commander Chen privately warned Diaz that extraction protocols were "unusual" and to exercise caution with anything recovered from the ruins.

Dr. Okafor, during pre-mission medical screening, noted Diaz's psychological profile exhibited subtle shifts following previous missions into the ruins. This pattern of cumulative change suggests possible influence from the xenoarchaeological site, though whether this represents contamination or deliberate effect remains unclassified.

### Team Composition

Expedition Alpha-7 consisted of eight personnel:

- **Staff Sergeant Elena Diaz** (Field Team Leader) - Sole survivor
- **Dr. Reinhardt** (Xenoarchaeological Expert) - Lost to psychological break, self-termination
- **Specialist Wei Chalmers** (Containment Systems) - Lost in molten sulfur during evacuation
- **Specialist Kwan** (Sensor Systems) - Killed by ruins' defensive mechanisms
- **Specialist Torres** (Security) - Dismembered by geometric blade mechanism
- **Specialist Jackson** (Demolitions) - Compressed to death by compromised EVS-7 suit
- **Specialist Rodriguez** (Structural Engineering) - Electrocuted by control panel
- **Specialist Ramirez** (Geological Expert) - Lost to floor collapse mechanism

### Mission Execution

The team deployed via ATV Crawler to the ruins entrance, which presented as a simple fissure in a sulfur ridge with no obvious artificial characteristics apart from precise dimensional measurements exactly accommodating EVS-7 suits with minimal clearance.

Upon entering, the team encountered architecture consistent with previous expeditions: smooth, seamless walls composed of unknown materials capable of withstanding Io's extreme geological conditions for millions of years. Dr. Reinhardt noted the symbolic patterns on the walls had changed since the previous expedition—evidence of adaptive behavior in what should be static architecture.

As the team progressed deeper, they documented several anomalous properties:
- Non-Euclidean spatial geometry (passages longer internally than external measurements would allow)
- Selective targeting of team members by various lethal mechanisms
- Radiation-absorbing properties in the construction materials
- Gravity manipulation within certain chambers
- Energy signatures that produced mathematical tonal sequences when converted to audio

The first casualty occurred when a section of floor beneath Specialist Ramirez simply ceased to exist, then rematerialized after he fell through. This pattern of selective targeting continued throughout the mission, with the structure appearing to "choose" specific individuals for elimination while allowing others to pass safely through identical spaces.

The team reached a spherical chamber with no distinction between floor, walls, and ceiling, featuring localized gravity manipulation that allowed walking on any surface. While exploring a connecting passage, Specialist Martinez reported hearing patterns in the energy field that he described as "the spaces between the notes—they're speaking." Before intervention was possible, he walked through what appeared to be a solid wall and was lost to what Dr. Reinhardt termed a "dimensional pocket." His final transmission described seeing "the patterns" and "the purpose" before termination.

Upon reaching the central chamber containing the artifact, Dr. Reinhardt began analyzing the non-Euclidean object suspended in what appeared to be a column of light but was described as "a visible absence, a hole in reality shaped like illumination." After brief examination, Reinhardt began reciting number sequences consistent with the phenomenon known as "The Counting"—a symptom previously documented in researchers with prolonged exposure to certain artifacts. He then walked calmly to a window opening and stepped through, falling to his death while continuing to recite the mathematical sequence.

The artifact's retrieval triggered violent defensive reactions from the structure, resulting in the deaths of Specialists Rodriguez, Jackson, and Torres through various mechanisms. During evacuation, a volcanic eruption claimed Specialist Chalmers, who sacrificed herself to ensure the artifact reached the outpost.

### Post-Mission Analysis

Upon return to Outpost Io-Alpha, medical examination revealed Diaz had survived radiation exposure levels of 40 jovs—theoretically sufficient to cause systemic failure, yet she exhibited minimal symptoms. Dr. Okafor noted this medical impossibility with concern.

More significantly, during post-mission isolation, Diaz experienced a hallucinatory episode in which her reflection exhibited non-human characteristics and spoke in Dr. Reinhardt's voice, stating: "The pattern repeats." This suggests the beginning of psychological changes consistent with early-stage artifact influence.

The artifact has been secured in containment within the Research Wing's Anomaly Containment section for further study under Dr. Nakamura's supervision.

## Pattern Analysis

This mission continues to demonstrate several concerning patterns observed across all xenoarchaeological expeditions:

1. **Selective Targeting** - The ruins' defensive mechanisms do not eliminate all intruders indiscriminately but appear to select specific individuals while allowing others (particularly Sergeant Diaz) to proceed.

2. **The Counting Phenomenon** - Multiple researchers exposed to the artifacts or ruins have experienced the compulsion to recite seemingly random numerical sequences before death or psychological break.

3. **Artifact Influence** - Proximity to certain artifacts appears to induce progressive psychological alterations, potentially culminating in what Dr. Nakamura terms "transformation" or "elevation."

4. **Sacrifice/Retrieval Pattern** - Catastrophic events consistently coincide with significant discoveries, particularly when artifacts are secured for transport to the outpost. This suggests a potential "cost" required for removal of items from the ruins.

5. **Diaz Exceptionalism** - Staff Sergeant Diaz has now survived three missions into the ruins with 100% casualty rates among other team members. This statistical impossibility suggests deliberate selection by whatever intelligence may operate within the structure.

## Security Classification

This document is classified Level Alpha. Unauthorized access will result in immediate termination.

## Addendum: The Pattern Repeats

Dr. Nakamura's translation of recurring symbols in the ruins suggests the concept of cyclical ascension—the ancient civilization that built these structures appears not to have been destroyed but "transformed" or "elevated" through contact with entities they depicted as dwelling "between spaces" or "outside the light."

Evidence now suggests Staff Sergeant Diaz may be undergoing the initial stages of a similar transformation process, having been selected by the ruins or artifacts for purposes currently unknown. Continued monitoring is warranted.
