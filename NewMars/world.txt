NEW MARS: WORLD DESCRIPTION

OVERVIEW:
Mars has been successfully terraformed through the systematic bombardment of ice-rich Kuiper Belt objects directed by autonomous drones. The once dead planet now features breathable atmosphere (requiring only light oxygen supplementation), vast oceans covering 30% of the surface, flowing rivers, and a functioning hydrological cycle. The temperature averages +5°C globally, with normal seasonal and geographic variations. Earth plants and simple animals have been introduced to create a nascent ecosystem.

GEOGRAPHY:
Key geographical features include the Northern Ocean (covering most northern lowlands), the Tharsis Highlands (remaining as a continental landmass), the Valles Marineris Sea (a massive inland water body), and the Hellas Basin Deep (the planet's deepest ocean). The terrain varies from mountainous regions like Olympus Mons to fertile plains in the terraformed lowlands. The planet exhibits a mixture of natural Martian features and newly created terrain resulting from terraforming impacts.

SETTLEMENTS:
Human colonization centers on several major settlements: Chryse Arcology (population 300,000), a massive domed city; the Marineris Trench Communities, a network of settlements along the inland sea; specialized research stations like Olympus Research Center; and various agricultural outposts. Many regions remain off-limits, designated as "ecological development zones" or research exclusion areas.

HISTORY:
Terraforming began approximately 30 years ago as Earth's climate deteriorated. The 25-year terraforming campaign was publicly hailed as humanity's greatest achievement, orchestrated by Maroque Corporation using advanced drone technology. However, the process awoke something ancient. Three years after terraforming completion, anomalous discoveries began occurring: crystalline organisms in water sources, rapidly evolving predatory arthropods, and most disturbingly, ancient ruins buried deep beneath the surface.

POLITICS & SOCIETY:
Mars is governed by Maroque Corporation through a technocratic structure that encompasses all aspects of colonial life. The corporation controls all infrastructure, law enforcement, research, and resource allocation. Citizens enjoy relative comfort within settlements but face increasing restrictions as Maroque struggles to contain the emerging threats. Society is stratified between scientific/administrative elites, general colonists, and maintenance/labor personnel. Information is tightly controlled, with most colonists unaware of the true nature of the threats facing Mars.

TECHNOLOGY:
Colonial technology is highly advanced, featuring fusion power, advanced transportation networks, extensive automation, and sophisticated life support systems. Medical technology includes nanite treatments and genetic optimization. However, the most groundbreaking technologies remain classified, as Maroque researchers study recovered Precursor artifacts. Public technology focuses on sustainability and terraforming maintenance, while military applications are developed in secret facilities.

DAILY LIFE:
Colonists experience a regulated existence with work assignments, scheduled recreation, and mandatory wellness checks. Water consumption and environmental exposure are carefully monitored. Every 37 days, settlements observe "atmospheric normalization procedures" requiring citizens to remain indoors—a cover for the periodic Synchronization Events affecting the mysterious Precursor systems. Despite increasing restrictions, most colonists remain optimistic about Mars' future, unaware that Maroque leadership has already accepted the planet will eventually be lost to the reawakening Precursor systems.

THE HIDDEN TRUTH:
What most colonists don't know is that the terraforming process was not random but seemingly guided toward specific outcomes. The drone swarms showed unexplained preferences for certain ice objects and impact locations. The three phenomena—Primordial Strain, Arachnomorphs, and Ancient Ruins—are not separate threats but components of a single integrated system created by the Precursors, an alien civilization that inhabited Mars 4.3 billion years ago. Every 37 days, all three phenomena synchronize with increased activity, gradually advancing the restoration of the Precursor biosphere that will ultimately undo human terraforming efforts. Maroque Corporation now focuses not on saving Mars but on extracting valuable Precursor technology before the inevitable loss of the planet.
