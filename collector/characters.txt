# CHARACTERS OF GLAMORGOON

## THE COLLECTOR

### DESCRIPTION
The Collector manifests on Earth as a Patrick Bateman-like figure - a perfectly tailored human male in his apparent early 30s with slicked-back dark hair, strong jawline, and calculating eyes. His appearance is unsettlingly perfect, as if he were a composite of every Wall Street banker from every film ever made rather than an actual person. He wears immaculate business attire with subtle blue accents that match the color of the Glamorgoon beam. His shoes—polished Oxford leather—reflect light with suspicious perfection. His smile extends a fraction too far and holds a moment too long, creating an uncanny valley effect. Occasionally his form flickers or glitches, momentarily revealing glimpses of his true form—described by witnesses as "geometric voids wearing the idea of a smile."

### AGE
While appearing to be in his early 30s in human form, The Collector is actually several centuries old in Glamorgoon years. Age is a complex concept for Glamorgoons, as their lifespans are tied to their GBTC holdings rather than biological processes. The Collector's actual age is reflected in subtle temporal disconnects - he occasionally responds to statements before they're fully articulated, creating the unsettling impression that he's experiencing a slightly different timeframe than humans.

### RACE
The Collector is a Glamorgoon - a member of the dominant species behind the intergalactic financial system. Modern Glamorgoons are physically uniform, having evolved from a previously specialized species with insect-like biological specialization. They are adapted for interdimensional travel and optimized for financial calculation. The Collector's true form is incomprehensible to human perception, requiring the adoption of a human avatar (the Patrick Bateman persona) to interact with Earth.

### PERSONALITY
The Collector operates with perfect emotional detachment, viewing humans exclusively as sources of value to be extracted. He can mimic human emotions with mathematical precision but feels none - his apparent warmth, concern, enthusiasm, or empathy are calculated performances designed to maximize value extraction. His personality is defined by:

- Absolute pragmatism with no ethical constraints
- Singular focus on profit and value accumulation
- Total inability to conceptualize non-Glamorgoon beings as having inherent worth
- Flawless confidence in the cosmic rightness of value extraction
- Mathematical approach to all interactions, constantly calculating optimal outcomes
- Religious devotion to the principles of value concentration
- Complete lack of empathy, though capable of perfectly simulating it when strategically useful

### QUIRKS
- Maintains impossibly perfect personal appearance with no visible effort
- Demonstrates inappropriate attentional focus - maintaining perfect eye contact beyond human comfort thresholds, then suddenly shifting attention to seemingly random objects
- Movement anomalies - moves with unsettling efficiency, with no wasted motion
- Occasionally glitches when experiencing strong emotional responses from humans
- Demonstrates unusual knowledge of personal financial details about people he's just met
- Becomes unnaturally excited by discussions of business cards or specific brands, while showing complete emotional flatness when discussing human suffering
- Occasionally stares at empty areas as if observing something invisible to human senses

### ROLE
The Collector serves as a representative of "on-Chain" Galactic Financial Services on Earth. His primary function is to integrate Earth into the Glamorgoon financial system and initiate the standard 100-year debt enslavement cycle. He is responsible for:

- Introducing humans to GBTC and Outernet services
- Creating and managing the initial Civilization Initialization Loan
- Implementing perception management protocols to maintain human ignorance
- Establishing dependencies through seemingly beneficial technologies
- Monitoring human responses to calibrate optimal manipulation techniques
- Identifying high-value individual targets for specialized extraction

The Collector may be a "derivative" - a Glamorgoon who previously lost status through underperformance and now serves as an anonymous functionary, seeking to regain status through successful exploitation of Earth markets.

## OTHER GLAMORGOON REPRESENTATIVES

While The Collector is the primary Glamorgoon representative described in the lore, multiple Glamorgoon agents operate on Earth simultaneously, each also using the Patrick Bateman avatar with subtle variations to allow humans to distinguish between different representatives. They include:

### SALES AVATARS
Implemented at 85% fidelity to the Bateman persona, these representatives focus on direct marketing of financial products. They have perfect recall of human cultural references through the early 2000s but display suspicious gaps in knowledge of more recent events.

### EXTRACTION SPECIALISTS
Implemented at 95% fidelity, these highly specialized representatives target wealthy humans for significant investment. They possess deep knowledge of human status signifiers and can engage in detailed discussions of wine vintages, restaurant reservations, and fashion designers.

### TERMINAL INTERFACES
The most disturbing manifestation, these representatives are deployed in the final stages of value extraction from particularly valuable targets. They intentionally allow the fictional character's pathological aspects to become increasingly apparent, creating a specialized form of terror that accelerates compliance.

## HUMAN COLLABORATORS

### THE PROXIES
Humans who have invested significant amounts in GBTC and undergone "alignment procedures." These humans are not mind-controlled but subtly influenced through quantum entanglement with their GBTC wallets. They genuinely believe they're acting of their own volition while perfectly advancing Glamorgoon interests. Identifiable by their tendency to use phrases like "universal financial sovereignty" and "value-optimal decision trees" in casual conversation.

### THE ASPIRATIONAL CLASS
Early GBTC adopters who receive disproportionate returns and social status, creating a visible class of enthusiastic advocates who genuinely believe in the system. Their authentic testimony is more persuasive than any direct Glamorgoon messaging.

### THE EXPERT CAPTIVES
Academics, economists, and technical experts who might identify systemic problems but have been offered prestigious "research opportunities" and "advisory positions" that provide generous compensation while subtly constraining their investigative directions.
