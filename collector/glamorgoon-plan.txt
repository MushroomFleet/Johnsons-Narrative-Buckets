Glamorgoon Lore Book
This document compiles known information regarding the Glamorgoon race, their intergalactic financial operations, and their interactions with less "advanced" species.
Entry 1: The Glamorgoon Race and "on-Chain"
The Glamorgoon are the dominant force behind the intergalactic financial system, operating under the monolithic entity known only as "on-Chain." Their society and power structure are founded upon a historical event referred to as the "airdrop," where the entirety of the Galactic Bitcoin (GBTC) supply was initially distributed. This event instantly created an aristocracy who, by simply HODLing their initial allocation, became the universe's most powerful and wealthy individuals. The "HODL Wars" erupted after the last coin was issued, solidifying GBTC's status as the sole worthwhile store of value and the de facto galactic reserve currency.
Glamorgoon culture is singularly focused on the accumulation of value, which is defined solely by GBTC holdings. They view other species primarily as sources of this value, ripe for exploitation through complex financial products and confidence schemes. They operate with a chilling pragmatism, prioritizing profit above all else. Concepts such as "ethics," "fairness," or "rights" for non-Glamorgoon species are considered irrelevant or even insulting.
"on-Chain" functions as the central authority for their operations, though its exact structure beyond being a single, vast entity is unclear to outsiders. Their reach is facilitated by interdimensional folding technology, allowing instant travel via "portals" rather than traditional spacecraft. However, access to this folding technology is restricted based on GBTC holdings, further reinforcing the class structure and controlling movement across the galaxy.
Entry 2: GBTC, The Outernet, and the Terms
Galactic Bitcoin (GBTC) is the cornerstone of the Glamorgoon financial empire. Marketed with hyperbolic claims like "not going to the moon, it's going to Andromeda," GBTC is presented as an ultra-bullish, ever-appreciating asset. While volatile in the short term, its fixed supply and the Glamorgoon's manipulation of the galactic economy ensure its long-term value only increases.
Intergalactic commerce and finance are conducted through "the Outernet," a network connecting civilizations. While ostensibly decentralized, "on-Chain" dictates its underlying rules. The Outernet is the primary vector for the Glamorgoons to introduce their financial products, including GBTC, intergalactic cashless payments, designer drugs, and pleasure robots, to new species.
A critical, and notoriously predatory, aspect of engaging with these services lies in the terms and conditions. By merely using any Glamorgoon service or the Outernet, a species implicitly agrees to the full terms. These terms are not readily accessible; they are purportedly located in the "disabled bathrooms at Alpha Centauri," signposted as "out of order" but unlocked. The document itself is written on weathered parchment in a language based purely on advanced mathematics, rendering it incomprehensible to most species, including humans. The inaccessibility is by design, allowing the Glamorgoons plausible deniability and placing the blame for ignorance squarely on the user.
Entry 3: "Plebs" and the Debt Enslavement Cycle
Within the Glamorgoon framework, most non-Glamorgoon species are classified as "plebs." This designation signifies their status as financial targets, lacking inherent rights on a galactic scale. Entry into the "galactic community" (and thus becoming a target) is triggered by technological milestones such as the invention of chip-and-pin technology or self-checkout systems – indicators of a species developing a financial infrastructure ripe for exploitation.
The primary method of exploitation is the 100-year debt enslavement cycle. This process, described as a "frog in a boiling pot," gradually integrates a planet into the Glamorgoon financial system, accumulating debt through compound interest (a standard 8% per annum, adjusted to the local solar period), hidden transaction fees, currency conversion costs, and the inherent volatility and rug pulls associated with GBTC and other products.
A chilling example is the tale of Ackerlamunpo Prime. When they dared to demand debt consolidation reforms, they were met with the standard "Pay or get bombed" response: an EMP threat and subsequent delivery, wiping out their technological golden era and returning them to a stone age existence with no memory of their advanced past. This demonstrates the Glamorgoons' enforcement method: no ground invasion, just the threat and use of force to reset a civilization if it becomes troublesome, protecting their financial interest by ensuring the debt remains the only path forward. The "protection" offered by being in debt is merely a racket – paying the Glamorgoons not to harm you or allow others to harm you, ensuring their investment (the debt) is secure.
The galactic bitcoin ledger, the record of all transactions and debt, is housed on a fully automated datacenter world in the Andromeda galaxy. This planet has been entirely consumed by the hardware required to confirm the ledger, its oceans drained for cooling, and its sun blotted out by polluted steam. No sentient life remains; it is a monument to the sheer scale and cost of the Glamorgoon's financial machine.
Entry 4: Arrival on Earth
The Glamorgoon arrival on Earth is not subtle. It is an overt, public spectacle initiated by the appearance of a "big blue beam" stretching into the sky. This beam serves no functional purpose beyond theatrical effect, designed to command immediate attention and awe. From this beam emerges a Glamorgoon agent, taking a form calculated to resonate (or perhaps disturb) the local population – in this instance, the unsettlingly familiar visage of Patrick Bateman.
Humanity is immediately classified as a "mark," an "easy target" for new crypto expansion and financial products. The Glamorgoons aim for 100% market saturation using aggressive tactics. Their initial marketing blitz mimics real-world crypto and NFT meme culture, using familiar visual styles, catchphrases, and platforms to create FOMO and lure in unsuspecting "investors."
While humans are initially unable to use interdimensional folding (being "no-coiners" or small holders), the Glamorgoons introduce other rebranded "Galactic Finance" products. These are insidious technologies and services designed to integrate into and disrupt existing Earth systems, creating dependency and subtly adding to the accumulating debt. The onus is always on humanity to "Do your own Research," a weaponized phrase used to dismiss any responsibility on the Glamorgoons' part for the inevitable financial ruin and enslavement. Ignorance is explicitly not a legal defense in their system.
