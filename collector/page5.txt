The Collector adjusted his tie. It was a perfectly reasonable action for a human-shaped entity to perform, though in his case it was entirely theatrical since the Windsor knot had been precision-engineered at the subatomic level to maintain optimal symmetry regardless of movement, interdimensional travel, or the occasional reality fluctuation that tended to occur when he got particularly excited about compound interest rates.

His penthouse suite occupied the top three floors of what humans considered their most prestigious financial address—a glass monument to capitalism that had, in an ironic twist completely lost on its inhabitants, been secretly constructed using architectural principles that made it an ideal focal point for certain quantum manipulations that absolutely weren't mind control but might perhaps be classified as "cognitive value optimization" in some of the more progressive jurisdictions of the galaxy.

Sixty-seven screens of varying sizes hovered before him, suspended in midair through technology that Earth's finest minds would misclassify as "anti-gravity" rather than recognizing it as the simple dimensional offset it actually was. The Collector watched with the precise amount of satisfaction that the completion of Phase One merited according to the Standard Extraction Manual (17.3% contentment, with an allowance for an additional 2.4% for Earth's exceptional extraction metrics).

"Record quarterly growth reported across all major markets," chirped a blonde financial reporter whose name The Collector had bothered to learn because she controlled 8.37% more viewer sentiment than her nearest competitor. "Experts are calling the Galactic Finance Revolution the most significant economic advancement since the invention of currency itself."

The Collector permitted himself a 0.47-second smile. 

On another screen, the President of the United States—a biological organism The Collector had personally selected from a carefully curated shortlist of optimally influenceable candidates—was signing the "Interstellar Financial Opportunity Act" which effectively surrendered national monetary sovereignty while being universally praised as a bold step toward human progress.

"The alignment efficiency exceeds projected parameters," The Collector remarked to no one in particular, his voice modulating through the exact frequencies shown to create subconscious trust in primate auditory systems. "Humanity's willingness to mistake value extraction for value creation represents an optimization variable we may need to adjust in future implementation protocols."

He rose from his ergonomically perfect chair—designed not for comfort but for maintaining the precise spinal alignment that maximized cognitive function while minimizing the microscopic tells that might reveal his non-human nature—and walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The city sprawled below him like a circuit board populated by components that had the curious delusion they were choosing their own paths.

The Collector reflected on the precision with which Phase One had been executed. The strategic elimination of problematic information vectors had been particularly satisfying. No crude assassinations or obvious disappearances—such methods were for species with no appreciation for elegant solutions. Instead, the troublesome reporters had been dealt with through the artful application of the Three-Vector Neutralization Strategy:

First, the majority had been simply recruited into the Expert Captivity Program, their skepticism transformed into enthusiastic advocacy through the careful application of status incentives, financial rewards, and subtle quantum entanglement with their GBTC wallets.

Second, the more resistant cases had been subjected to carefully calibrated reputation destruction campaigns, their credibility systematically dismantled through the strategic deployment of increasingly preposterous conspiracy theories that incorporated just enough actual truth to render all their legitimate concerns guilty by association.

Third—and The Collector found this particular solution mathematically beautiful—the most stubborn investigative elements had been promoted so aggressively into positions of such extraordinary power and compensation that they had voluntarily neutralized themselves, a process The Collector's internal briefing had termed "extraction immunity through extraction optimization."

"Complimentary refreshment arrived for the distinguished representative of Galactic Financial Services," announced the penthouse AI assistant in a voice specifically modulated to sound just human enough to avoid triggering uncanny valley responses while retaining a subservient quality that reinforced proper hierarchical positioning.

A hovering tray emerged from what appeared to be solid wall but was actually a localized dimensional fold. The Collector surveyed the offering with precisely calibrated appreciation:

A glass of 1982 Château Lafite Rothschild—selected not for its taste (Glamorgoons had no sense of taste, just a mathematical appreciation for scarcity and human status indicators).

A small bowl of beluga caviar—arranged in a pattern that, if viewed from the correct non-human visual spectrum, displayed the exact coordinates where Earth would be positioned in the Glamorgoon financial archives.

And a single, perfectly geometrical cube of a substance that hadn't been invented on Earth yet and would never be invented on Earth, which glowed with a light that wasn't quite any color humans could perceive and which would, if consumed by a human, simultaneously trigger every pleasure center in their brain before causing instant death—not that The Collector would ever waste such a valuable resource on mere recreation.

The Collector reclined on his custom-designed lounger, which adjusted to support his simulated bodily form at precisely the angles that would appear most human while allowing optimal energy conservation. He raised his wine glass in a mockery of human celebration rituals.

"To the successful commencement of the 100-year debt cycle," he non-toasted, speaking into a quantum entanglement communicator disguised as a minimalist sculpture. "Earth implementation proceeding at 117.3% of standard efficiency metrics. Request permission to accelerate Phase Two timeline due to exceptional extraction potential and concerning rates of pattern recognition among outlier human specimens."

The response from on-Chain arrived instantaneously, despite the vast galactic distances involved—one of the many advantages of technology that treated the space-time continuum less as an immutable law and more as a polite suggestion.

"Permission granted. Vulnerability analysis indicates accelerated implementation will optimize extraction yield by 22.7%. Proceed with temporal compression of Phase Two."

The Collector allowed himself the luxury of a 1.3-second genuine emotional response—a practically hedonistic indulgence by Glamorgoon standards. The resulting feeling could be roughly translated as "mathematically justifiable satisfaction at system optimization," though Earth languages lacked the conceptual framework to express it properly.

Outside, the city's lights twinkled in the gathering dusk, millions of humans going about their lives with absolutely no comprehension that they had already been fully incorporated into an extraction system designed to convert their existence into portable value. They were celebrating their shiny new financial opportunities, examining their growing GBTC wallets, and eagerly anticipating the miraculous technologies promised in the next phase of galactic integration.

The Collector sipped his wine—a completely unnecessary action that nevertheless completed the aesthetic tableau of a successful entity enjoying the fruits of his labor. Far below, a digital billboard cycled through Galactic Finance advertisements, the blue glow illuminating upturned human faces with the exact frequency shown to maximize dopamine response during financial decision-making.

"Not going to the moon," one slogan proclaimed in glowing letters. "Going to Andromeda."

The Collector permitted himself a precise 4.2-second chuckle. The statement was, technically speaking, the only completely accurate information in the entire Glamorgoon marketing campaign.

It just wasn't the humans who would be making the journey.
