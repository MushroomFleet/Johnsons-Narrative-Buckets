# THE WORLD OF GLAMORGOON

## EARTH
Earth exists in the present day, largely as we know it, but with one critical difference - it has been targeted for integration into the vast intergalactic financial system controlled by the Glamorgoon race. Earth is classified as a "mark" and an "easy target" for cryptocurrency expansion and financial products. Currently in the earliest stages of the Glamorgoon's standard 100-year debt enslavement cycle, Earth's population remains largely unaware of the true nature of this integration. The Glamorgoons have made their presence known through dramatic "blue beam" appearances, from which their representatives emerge to introduce humanity to "galactic finance." Earth is particularly vulnerable due to its existing financial structures, tendency toward short-term thinking, and pre-existing wealth inequality.

## THE GLAMORGOON CIVILIZATION

The Glamorgoons are the dominant force behind the intergalactic financial system, operating under a monolithic entity known as "on-Chain." Their entire civilization is built around the accumulation of value, defined exclusively by Galactic Bitcoin (GBTC) holdings. They view other species primarily as sources of value to be exploited through complex financial products and confidence schemes.

Their reach spans multiple galaxies, facilitated by interdimensional folding technology that allows instant travel via "portals." Access to this technology is restricted based on GBTC holdings, reinforcing their strict class structure. Their operations center on a fully automated datacenter world in the Andromeda galaxy, a planet entirely consumed by the hardware required to maintain the GBTC blockchain.

## HISTORY

The Glamorgoon society was fundamentally shaped by an event known as "the airdrop" approximately 17,000 years ago. Before this event, Glamorgoons were a communal species with biological specialization similar to Earth's social insects. The creation of Galactic Bitcoin (GBTC) and its initial distribution instantly created an aristocracy of wealthy Glamorgoons.

This economic revolution triggered rapid biological changes. Within ten generations, specialized variants began to disappear, replaced by a more homogeneous Glamorgoon phenotype optimized for GBTC acquisition. The modern Glamorgoon—physically uniform, cognitively optimized for financial calculation, and biologically adapted to interdimensional travel—emerged as a direct evolutionary response to the selection pressures introduced by GBTC.

The galactic power structure was solidified after the catastrophic HODL Wars, a decade-long conflict that permanently altered the structure of known space and established GBTC as the sole galactic reserve currency. This conflict led to the formation of "on-Chain" as a unified entity to manage galactic finance and the establishment of the debt-based system now implemented across countless worlds.

## CULTURE

Glamorgoon culture is singularly focused on the accumulation of value. They operate with chilling pragmatism, prioritizing profit above all else. Concepts such as "ethics," "fairness," or "rights" for non-Glamorgoon species are considered irrelevant or even insulting.

Their social interactions are dictated by wealth. When two Glamorgoons meet, they immediately exchange their current GBTC holdings through secure quantum channels, establishing the power dynamic for the entire interaction. The Glamorgoon with fewer holdings automatically adopts a submissive posture, while the wealthier one speaks with greater authority.

Despite presenting themselves to other species as purely rational economic actors, Glamorgoons maintain a rich internal mythology that justifies their exploitative practices. They believe that exchange and valuation are not merely economic activities but the fundamental cosmic principle that creates and sustains reality. They see themselves as guardians of this primordial process, bringing the "truth of transaction" to "pre-enlightened" species.

Their society operates with brutal efficiency. Underperforming Glamorgoons are subjected to "efficiency recalibration," stripped of their GBTC holdings and identity, and reduced to anonymous functionaries called "derivatives" who perform the most dangerous or demeaning tasks.

## RELATIONSHIP WITH EARTH

The Glamorgoons have identified Earth as having "exceptional extraction potential" due to humans' pre-existing familiarity with abstract value concepts, internal competition patterns, and tendency toward temporal discounting (prioritizing short-term benefits over long-term costs).

Their approach to Earth follows their standard pattern for new worlds: a dramatic public arrival (the blue beam), followed by the introduction of seemingly beneficial technologies that create dependencies and disrupt existing systems. They position themselves as bringing advanced financial opportunities while concealing their true intent - to subject humanity to a 100-year cycle of increasing debt and resource extraction.

The Glamorgoons employ sophisticated strategies to maintain human ignorance, including exploiting existing cognitive biases, flooding information channels with excessive and contradictory data, capturing trusted institutions, and creating social structures that outsource ignorance enforcement to humans themselves.

Earth is currently experiencing the earliest implementation of Glamorgoon integration, with the alien visitors carefully monitoring human responses to calibrate optimal manipulation techniques for maximum value extraction.
