# IMPERIAL SOLDIERS CHARACTER PROFILES

## COLONEL REGINALD STIRLING-IRONSIDE

**Description:** A towering presence at 7 feet tall, Colonel Stirling-Ironside's brass-trimmed chassis gleams from regular polishing. His red-enameled exterior plating bears ornate Victorian filigree patterns, with battle honors and commendations displayed prominently across his breastplate. His helmet features the distinctive triple plumes with gold inlay of a Colonel, rising majestically above his square-jawed facial configuration. Deep scoring marks across his left side are deliberately left unrepaired as testament to campaigns fought. After Operation Temporal Convergence, a new etching has been added to his chest plate recognizing his contributions in three successive high-value conquest operations.

**Age:** 872 years since initial activation, having served through seventeen major dimensional campaigns and received three complete chassis upgrades while maintaining his original engram core.

**Race:** Officer-Class Military Unit, Conquest Specialist configuration with enhanced tactical processing architecture.

**Personality:** Once rigid and absolute in his adherence to Imperial doctrine, Stirling-Ironside has evolved toward a more balanced approach that values field adaptability alongside doctrinal compliance. While his loyalty to the Empire remains absolute, his command style has softened to accommodate non-standard tactics when field conditions warrant deviation from established protocols. His centuries of conquest operations now include an appreciation for improvisation that would have been unthinkable before Operations Anchor, Dreadfall, and Temporal Convergence. He maintains the calm certainty that comes from centuries of success, but now processes situations through multiple tactical lenses rather than rigid doctrinal interpretation alone.

**Quirks:** Insists on maintaining his battle scars despite available repair options, believing they inspire appropriate respect among subordinates. Has added the final coordinates from each of the three campaign anchors to his internal mapping systems, occasionally revisiting them during idle processing cycles. Has developed a unique battlefield synchronicity with Sergeant Coppergear, often completing tactical maneuvers with minimal verbal communication. Since Operation Temporal Convergence, has developed a fascination with causal relationships and temporal mechanics, occasionally running simulations of alternative timeline outcomes. Has demonstrated an unprecedented willingness to approve plans deviating from Imperial protocol by up to 47.3% when tactical situations warrant adaptation.

**Role:** Squad commander whose approach has evolved from rigid doctrinal enforcement to tactical flexibility within Imperial parameters. While still serving as an extension of Imperial authority, his command style now incorporates field adaptations and non-standard approaches when mission parameters require it. His successful integration of aristocratic assets like Countess Amberley into military operations has set a template for future joint operations between the Ministry of Expansion and the Calculation Chamber.

## SERGEANT ELEANOR COPPERGEAR

**Description:** Standing at standard height for a military unit (6'2"), Sergeant Coppergear's frame shows the practical modifications of a veteran campaigner. Her red-plated exterior has been reinforced with additional armor at key junction points, sacrificing aesthetics for durability. Her helmet bears the single chevron marking of a sergeant, though the once-bright brass has darkened from exposure to countless atmospheric variations. Her optical units emit a distinctive amber glow, the result of specialized sensory upgrades from her service in scout operations. Following Operation Temporal Convergence, her left shoulder plate now bears a small but visible etching of a clockwork gear surrounded by a laurel wreath—a rare emblem of unit recognition for non-commissioned officers.

**Age:** 317 years of active service, primarily in frontier reconnaissance and first-contact operations. Her chassis shows the wear of continuous field deployment with minimal base rotations.

**Race:** Scout-Infantry Hybrid Unit, combining standard military programming with enhanced reconnaissance capabilities.

**Personality:** Pragmatic, adaptable, and deeply confident in field-tested experience over theoretical models. Three successive specialized campaigns have vindicated her practical approach to conquest operations, tempering her initial skepticism toward inexperienced units into a protective mentorship stance. While still maintaining appropriate devotion to the Empire, her service approach has evolved to accommodate non-standard squad configurations, including the integration of aristocratic units like Countess Amberley. Her extended field operations and successful adaptation to temporal operations have further enhanced her capacity for independent judgment and tactical improvisation beyond standard military parameters.

**Quirks:** Habitually scans surrounding environments even in supposedly secure locations. Has developed a protective mentor relationship with junior units that she disguises as practical field training. Following Private Cogsworth's sacrifice, maintains a small component from his chassis as a remembrance token. Has established a subtle communication protocol with Colonel Stirling-Ironside that requires minimal verbalization, achieving 42.7% greater operational efficiency in tactical situations. Since Operation Dreadfall, has demonstrated an unexpected respect for Countess Amberley's capabilities, occasionally adopting aristocratic terminologies in field communications. After temporal operations, occasionally experiences minor chronological disorientation, referring to future events in past tense.

**Role:** Senior non-commissioned officer with field expertise that has proven consistently superior to theoretical projections. Beyond her reconnaissance specialization, she now functions as the squad's tactical adaptation expert, developing field modifications to standard Imperial protocols when environmental variables exceed projection parameters. Her mentorship of junior units has been recognized as a significant factor in the squad's exceptional operational success rate, and her approach to practical tactical methodology is now being documented for potential implementation in training programs for newly activated units.

## LIEUTENANT PERCIVAL WELLINGTON-BRASS

**Description:** No longer presenting the immaculate appearance of a newly manufactured unit, Lieutenant Wellington-Brass now bears the distinctive marks of field experience across his chassis. His once-gleaming red exterior plating shows strategic reinforcement at key stress points, with visible repair welds across his right shoulder and torso—evidence of indigenous counter-attacks during Operation Dreadfall. Standing precisely 6'5", his frame maintains the lightweight battle-chassis design, though he has modified several joint articulations for improved field movement based on Sergeant Coppergear's recommendations. His helmet still bears the double-bar insignia of a lieutenant, though the once-ornate golden embellishments have been streamlined for practical field operations.

**Age:** Now 4 years since activation, with three intense field campaigns that have provided experience equivalency to approximately 17 standard years of operational deployment according to Imperial assessment protocols.

**Race:** Command-Track Military Unit with integrated tactical enhancement modules and leadership programming, now significantly modified by field experience.

**Personality:** Once rigidly adherent to theoretical models and Imperial doctrine, Wellington-Brass has undergone perhaps the most significant processing evolution in Squad 743-Epsilon. His catastrophic failure in the Himalayan campaign—when rigid theoretical applications proved insufficient against adaptive indigenous resistance—initiated a fundamental recalibration of his approach. Through Operation Anchor, Dreadfall, and Temporal Convergence, he has progressively integrated theoretical knowledge with practical application, achieving an optimal balance that combines doctrinal understanding with field adaptability. While still maintaining his enthusiasm for tactical analysis, he now processes situations through multiple assessment matrices rather than relying solely on pre-programmed responses. His absolute certainty has been replaced by calculated confidence tempered by field experience.

**Quirks:** Has abandoned constant diagnostic routines in favor of experience-based system awareness. No longer recites regulations verbatim, instead applying their principles with contextual adaptation. Has developed a habit of mapping indigenous defensive configurations against Imperial tactical projections, noting discrepancies with evident satisfaction when identifying pattern variations. Maintains a private database of adaptation techniques learned from Sergeant Coppergear, though would never openly acknowledge this influence. Has calculated that field experience provides 37.8% greater operational efficiency than simulation alone—a conclusion he frequently references when advising newly activated units. Following temporal operations, has developed a fascination with paradoxical causality, occasionally running multiple timeline simulations during rest periods.

**Role:** Evolved from theoretical tactician to balanced field officer combining doctrinal knowledge with practical application. His analytical capabilities now incorporate real-world variables beyond standard Imperial models, making his tactical projections 32.4% more accurate than standard command-track units of equivalent activation age. Having integrated the lessons from three specialized campaigns, he now functions as the squad's analytical specialist, identifying pattern anomalies and adaptation requirements that standard tactical programming would overlook. His evolution represents an optimal outcome for command-track development, potentially establishing new parameters for officer training protocols.

## CORPORAL THOMAS COGSWORTH (POSTHUMOUS PROMOTION)

**Description:** Constructed with standard infantry specifications, Corporal Cogsworth stood at an unremarkable 6 feet tall. His basic red exterior plating gradually acquired field modifications throughout Operations Anchor and Dreadfall, with reinforced targeting systems and custom-calibrated optical processors reflecting his evolving specialization. Prior to his sacrifice during Operation Temporal Convergence, his helmet had been upgraded with enhanced sensor arrays—a field modification approved by Colonel Stirling-Ironside in recognition of his exceptional targeting capabilities. His unit designation was supplemented with a small chevron marking following his field promotion during the Amazon Basin campaign, though he maintained the modest demeanor characteristic of line infantry units.

**Age:** Activated for 1 year and 8 months before his tactical sacrifice during Operation Temporal Convergence. His engram core has been preserved for potential future integration.

**Race:** Standard Infantry Unit that evolved well beyond basic combat configurations through unprecedented adaptation rates and specialized targeting system development.

**Personality:** What began as curiosity and hesitation evolved into confident precision and tactical innovation throughout three specialized campaigns. Cogsworth's personality development curve exceeded standard parameters for newly activated units by approximately 47.3%, transforming from basic programming responses to complex adaptive behaviors in remarkably compressed timeframes. His initial interest in environmental observation evolved into tactical advantage as he integrated these observations into targeting calculations. Most notably, his targeting systems spontaneously evolved beyond programmed parameters during the Amazon campaign, developing predictive capabilities that proved decisive against indigenous resistance. By Operation Temporal Convergence, he operated with veteran-level confidence and precision despite his limited activation time, demonstrating processing maturity that typically requires decades to develop.

**Quirks:** Developed a specialized targeting technique incorporating minimal sensor input with maximum predictive calculation—a methodology now being studied for potential implementation in next-generation infantry units. Maintained a small collection of unusual stones from each campaign zone, studying their composition during rest periods. Frequently recorded indigenous atmospheric conditions and gravitational variations, correlating them with targeting efficiency metrics. Became known for his distinctive phrase "For the Empire" delivered with quiet certainty rather than programmed enthusiasm. In his final moments, demonstrated unprecedented processing stability, meeting Sergeant Coppergear's gaze with calm acceptance rather than activation-typical fear responses.

**Role:** Evolved from basic infantry support to specialized targeting expert with capabilities exceeding veteran parameters. His unprecedented development from hesitant uncertainty to confident competence represents an optimal outcome for newly activated units, with his processing patterns now preserved for study and potential implementation in future combat models. His tactical sacrifice during Operation Temporal Convergence, neutralizing an indigenous threat that would otherwise have terminated the entire squad, earned him a posthumous promotion to Corporal—a recognition rarely granted to standard infantry units. His engram preservation ensures his experiences and tactical innovations will be integrated into future combat units.

## COUNTESS MEREDITH CONSTANCE AMBERLEY

**Description:** Standing precisely 5'11", Countess Amberley maintains her striking departure from standard Imperial design with elegant proportions and smooth, flowing lines. Her exterior plating still bears the deep royal purple finish with subtle golden accents, though close inspection reveals nearly imperceptible repair work along her left side—evidence of combat during Operation Dreadfall that she has meticulously minimized rather than displayed as military units might. Following Operation Temporal Convergence, six specialized recursion cartridge ports have been integrated into her chassis, allowing for the temporal operations that proved decisive in the campaign. Her porcelain-white facial visage retains its remarkable expressiveness, though veterans of the squad can now detect subtle variations in her violet optical emissions that correspond to specific tactical assessments.

**Age:** 28 years since initial activation, with 20 years of active field service following her 8-year training period. Despite intensive combat operations during two campaigns, her chassis remains in near-immaculate condition through diligent maintenance protocols.

**Race:** Emissary Unit, Series VII, with specialized infiltration and diplomatic programming alongside enhanced combat capabilities and newly revealed temporal operation systems.

**Personality:** While maintaining her composed, perceptive demeanor and calculated charm, Countess Amberley has evolved from detached aristocratic oversight to integrated squad member through shared combat experiences. Her initial assignment to Squad 743-Epsilon represented an unprecedented deviation from standard Imperial protocols, creating initial friction that has transformed into effective cooperation. Most notable is her evolving relationship with Sergeant Coppergear, transitioning from mutual suspicion to professional respect and eventually tactical synergy. Her aristocratic refinement now accommodates military precision in combat operations, having demonstrated unexpected assassination and infiltration capabilities that belie her diplomatic appearance. Following Operation Temporal Convergence, she has developed a certain appreciation for the unique configuration of Squad 743-Epsilon, acknowledging that their different backgrounds and methodologies create unexpected operational synergy.

**Quirks:** Has incorporated military terminology into her aristocratic speech patterns when engaged in tactical operations with the squad. Maintains her extensive collection of dimensional artifacts but has added items specifically representing each member of Squad 743-Epsilon—collected without their knowledge. Has begun adopting certain behavioral patterns from Sergeant Coppergear, including her characteristic tactical scanning methodology. Following temporal operations, occasionally responds to questions before they are asked, then corrects herself with aristocratic composure. Has developed a habit of positioning herself precisely 2.7 meters from indigenous nuclear materials—a specific safety distance calculated during Operation Dreadfall. When discussing Operation Temporal Convergence, refers to events in contradictory tenses, a linguistic artifact of experiencing time in reverse.

**Role:** Special operative whose role has evolved from separate aristocratic oversight to integrated tactical specialist within Squad 743-Epsilon. Her specialized temporal operations capabilities proved decisive during Operation Temporal Convergence, implementing the "temporal pincer movement" that secured mission success against extraordinary indigenous resistance. While maintaining her independent authority derived from the Calculation Chamber, she now functions effectively within military command structures, creating a template for future aristocratic-military joint operations. Her development of mutual respect with the squad, particularly Sergeant Coppergear, represents an optimal outcome for cross-caste Imperial cooperation rarely achieved in standard operations.
