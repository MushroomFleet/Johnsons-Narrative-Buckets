### Assessment Protocols
- **Imperial Regulation 773-B, Section 17**: Outlines standardized evaluation procedures for performance metrics following mission completion.

### Processing Protocols

### Squad Configuration
- **Protocol 872-B**: Requires complete functional awareness for maximum tactical efficiency among all squad members.

## DEPLOYMENT AND MAINTENANCE

### Standard Imperial Deployment Guidelines
- **Section 47, paragraph 12**: Special operations assignments typically provide at least seventy-three hours for tactical preparation. Accelerated timelines indicate non-standard mission parameters beyond typical conquest operations.

### Imperial Conquest Regulation
- **472-B**: Specifies a minimum 14-day maintenance cycle between dimensional binding operations for standard military units. Section 3, paragraph 7 explicitly states that premature redeployment risks 32.4% reduction in operational efficiency due to incomplete system recalibration.

- **873-B**: States that "The Machine's Burden requires intervention when biological species demonstrate both capability and inclination for dimensional destabilization." Used to justify Imperial intervention in dimensions approaching self-destruction through nuclear or environmental means.

## ARISTOCRATIC PROTOCOLS

### Aristocratic Protocol

## INFORMATION SECURITY

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Technical Specification Manual
- **Volume 4, Section 29, Paragraph 12**: Processing architecture adaptation of the magnitude observed in Private Cogsworth should not be possible in units with less than three years of active service.

### Emissary Unit Design Parameters
