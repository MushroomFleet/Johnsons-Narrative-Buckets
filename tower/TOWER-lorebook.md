# THE TOWER-RAIDING COMPENDIUM
## A Practical Guide to Impractical Heists

### INTRODUCTION: A PERFECTLY REASONABLE OCCUPATION

In the rolling meadows and mist-shrouded forests of Spellwick—a land where magic flows as commonly as water and slightly more commonly than common sense—there exists a peculiar economic arrangement. Towers. 

Lots of towers.

The landscape is dotted with them, architectural exclamation marks interrupting the otherwise pleasant scenery like pimples on the face of an otherwise attractive geography. These stone phalluses of magical overcompensation serve as both homes and status symbols for the realm's community of sorcerers, who, having apparently never encountered the concept of a bungalow, insist on building vertically with a fervor that would make urban developers weep with envy.

This would be merely an aesthetic concern—perhaps warranting nothing more than strongly worded letters to the Magical Zoning Commission—if not for the fact that these towers contain STUFF. Important stuff. Magical stuff. Stuff that other magical practitioners (who prefer sensible cottages, thank you very much) want rather desperately; stuff they are willing to pay handsomely to acquire; stuff they might have simply borrowed had the sorcerers not developed an unfortunate habit of setting fire to dinner guests who ask too many questions about their collections.

And thus was born the noble profession of Tower Raiding—a career path combining the breaking-and-entering skills of burglary, the danger management techniques of dragon dentistry, and the paperwork requirements of moderate-level tax accounting.

## THE TOWER ECONOMY

### Wizards vs. Sorcerers: A Study in Magical Capitalism

The fundamental difference between wizards and sorcerers can be summarized as follows:
- Wizards studied for their powers, wear sensible robes, and maintain organized libraries
- Sorcerers were born with their powers, dress like magical peacocks, and maintain towers full of booby-trapped treasure
- Both groups are equally insufferable at parties, though for entirely different reasons

Wizards, being the studious sort who value knowledge above all else (except perhaps a good filing system), frequently discover that they require specific magical artifacts for their research—artifacts that, through cosmic coincidence or narrative necessity, happen to be gathering dust in sorcerers' towers. Rather than engaging in open academic dialogue or establishing a magical lending library system, they instead post job advertisements at local taverns, hoping to attract adventurers with more courage than survival instinct. Some wizards, such as Albrus the Methodical of the prestigious Arcane Collegium, have elevated this practice to an art form, commissioning expeditions for items like the Orb of Astounding Revelations with the precision timing of a celestial event calculator and the moral flexibility of a politician during tax season.

Sorcerers, meanwhile, continue collecting magical trinkets with the obsessive dedication of a child hoarding shiny pebbles—though pebbles rarely cause spontaneous transfiguration or summoning of entities from the Nth dimension. They store these items throughout their towers with protection that ranges from simple locked doors to elaborate traps involving quantum riddles, domesticated gelatinous cubes, and the occasional reality-bending paradox. Recent intelligence suggests that more forward-thinking sorcerers, like Zarathximagius, have begun implementing countermeasures against predictable theft attempts, including the strategic relocation of valuable artifacts prior to astronomically significant dates and the scheduling of monthly sensory deprivation rituals during periods of anticipated vulnerability.

The system operates with a peculiar equilibrium; wizards fund the adventuring industry, adventurers sustain the trap-making and monster-breeding industries, and sorcerers periodically rebuild their collections while muttering about installing better security systems—a cycle of economic interdependence that somehow manages to keep everyone simultaneously employed and in constant peril.

### The Emerging Threat: Sorcerous Alliances and Vertical Integration

The delicate balance of the tower economy now faces an unprecedented disruption: sorcerers have discovered cooperation. This development is approximately as concerning as discovering that sharks have developed a taste for real estate and begun purchasing beachfront property.

The Quadrumvirate of Quantifiable Quandaries—a name clearly chosen by committee after rejecting alternatives for having insufficient alliteration—represents the first documented alliance of sorcerers who have decided that sharing a workspace might be more efficient than maintaining four separate towers with four separate insurance policies. This coalition of Zarathximagius, Noxiventus the Nefarious (whose beard appears to be making a sincere attempt to escape his face), Belladonna Vex (specialist in Miscalculations and Unscheduled Renovations), and a fourth member who hovers slightly above the ground and maintains facial symmetry to a degree that would make professional portrait artists weep with envy, has demonstrated an alarming capacity for coordinated action.

Their stated objective of controlling "tower-to-wizard transactions" suggests an attempt to vertically integrate the artifact supply chain, potentially eliminating the need for adventuring middlemen—a business development approximately as popular among tower raiders as "combustible lockpicks" or "discount resurrection services with a no-refund policy."

More concerning still is the alliance's shift from passive defense to active hunter-prey dynamics, as evidenced by substantial bounties placed on known successful tower raiders. When sorcerers begin investing 5,000 gold crowns per adventurer (with premium rates for specialists with unusual capabilities), it indicates a concerning pivot in their business model from "isolated collectors occasionally inconvenienced by theft" to "proactive eliminators of professional competition."

Intelligence gathered during brief periods of consciousness between sleeping gas exposure and mercenary interrogation suggests the Quadrumvirate's ultimate goal may be related to the acquisition of something called the "Chromatic Codex," an artifact of sufficient power and mystery to justify both four-way sorcerous collaboration and elaborate schemes involving false marketplace rumors about bottomless tankards.

## TOWER ARCHITECTURE AND DANGER DYNAMICS

### The Vertically Integrated Hazard System

Sorcerers' towers traditionally follow a standardized architectural philosophy that can only be described as "increasingly lethal verticality." This design principle—which appears in no formal architectural journal yet is somehow universally adopted—dictates that danger increases proportionally with elevation, adhering to the ancient magical formula: 

> D = F × (L² + M) ÷ CS

Where D represents Danger, F represents Flashiness of magical effects, L represents tower Level, M represents number of Monsters, and CS represents the adventurer's Common Sense (typically approaching zero).

The ground floor typically presents a welcoming façade of reasonable security measures: conventional locks, sleepy guards with poor peripheral vision, and perhaps the occasional animated armor that creaks loudly enough to announce its presence from three rooms away. These token deterrents serve less as actual protection and more as a way for sorcerers to later claim, "Well, I did TRY to keep people out" when filing insurance claims.

Access points beyond the main entrance may include drainage tunnels, which recent expeditions suggest have a 63.7% probability of being deliberate traps according to battle-mathematical analysis. The counterintuitive conclusion here is that intentional vulnerabilities are often more reliable entry points than accidental ones, as they're designed to funnel intruders into predictable paths rather than collapsing unexpectedly due to poor maintenance.

As adventurers ascend, they encounter increasingly improbable hazards: corridors that defy Euclidean geometry; rooms that randomly transpose with other rooms; staircases that lead simultaneously up AND down; trap mechanisms requiring such specific timing that one suspects the sorcerer employs a part-time choreographer; and magical barriers with riddles so convoluted they make tax legislation seem straightforward by comparison.

By the uppermost floors, reality itself becomes negotiable. Gravity may operate in multiple directions simultaneously; time might flow backwards on Tuesdays; and creatures may appear that consist of nothing but teeth, eyeballs, and existential questions. The pinnacle of the tower—where the most valuable relics are invariably kept—typically exists in a state of quantum uncertainty, simultaneously being and not being there until observed by someone with the proper magical clearance and a signed liability waiver.

### Architectural Innovation: The United Sorcerers' Tower

The emergence of sorcerous alliances has spawned a disturbing new architectural trend: the multi-sorcerer merged tower. The United Sorcerers' Tower stands as a case study in what happens when four practitioners with wildly different aesthetic sensibilities attempt to combine their living spaces without consulting a single interior designer.

The structure represents the physical merging of four distinct tower styles into a single collaborative workspace—a feat of architectural improbability that magical theorists consider either revolutionary or symptomatic of impending apocalyptic events, with little middle ground in the debate. Each quadrant maintains the unique stylistic choices of its original owner: one section featuring traditional spires and turrets, another displaying modernist geometric patterns with randomly placed windows, a third constructed from materials that shouldn't logically hold together, and a fourth existing in a state of quantum uncertainty that somehow appears both taller and shorter than the others depending on viewing angle.

Merged towers present unique challenges for would-be raiders. On one hand, they offer the efficiency of stealing from four sorcerers during a single break-in—the burglary equivalent of a buy-three-get-one-free special. On the other hand, they concentrate multiple sorcerous defense systems, guardian types, and monitoring capabilities in a single location, creating what risk assessment specialists might classify as a "catastrophically hazardous work environment with insufficient occupational safety standards."

The practical vulnerabilities of such structures include maintenance access points created by the integration of multiple plumbing systems—it turns out that even reality-bending sorcerers require functional waste management—and strategic structural weaknesses resulting from hasty architectural mergers. Field experience suggests that the northwest corner support pillars of such merged structures present optimal targets for what engineers might classify as "enthusiastic horizontal architectural revision" during hasty exits.

### The Specialized Guardian Hierarchy

Field research has revealed that modern sorcerers have evolved beyond generic animated statues and random summoned demons, now employing specialized security personnel with thematic powers aligned to specific tower levels. Notable examples documented in the Zarathximagius expedition include:

**Level 2: Animated Armor Division** - Military-themed constructs bearing heraldic designs from historically significant units, operating with regiment-level coordination and apparently vulnerable to rapid oxidation alchemical compounds.

**Level 3: Prismatic Specialists** - Exemplified by Lady Prismatica, First Illuminator of the Seventh Spectrum, these guardians deploy chromatic barrages, behavioral modification beams, and weaponized craft supplies. Combat reports indicate extreme vulnerability to recursive energy loops created using specialized mirrors, though the lingering glitter contamination represents a significant occupational hazard.

**Level 4: Temporal Manipulators** - Embodied by Pendleton Chronos, the Chronolibrarian, these guardians maintain collections of cross-timeline literature while wielding age regression fields that can temporarily reduce targets to earlier developmental stages. Countermeasures involve the harvesting of chronometric energy from regulatory timepieces.

**Level 5: Reality Couturiers** - Represented by Sir Puffington III, Wardrobe Master of the Interdimensional Catwalk, these entities specialize in "reinventing" intruders through non-Euclidean makeovers and dimensional restructuring. Surprisingly vulnerable to the direct application of physical force by warriors who simply refuse to acknowledge dimensional limitations.

**Level 7 (Pinnacle): Support Staff** - Perhaps the most unexpected defensive layer, exemplified by Mathilda, housekeeper to Zarathximagius. These non-combat personnel nevertheless play crucial roles in tower operations and occasionally provide complimentary high-quality baked goods as professional courtesy following technically successful but practically failed raids.

### New Threat: Coordinated External Operations

Beyond architectural innovations, the emergence of sorcerous alliances has introduced a concerning new category of threats operating outside tower walls. Field documentation reveals an elaborate ecosystem of mercenary forces, disinformation specialists, and targeted entrapment operations:

**Elite Mercenary Teams** - Highly trained units employing matching equipment, magical communication devices, and professional tactics including the deployment of sleeping gas through ventilation systems. Typically commanded by individuals related to sorcerous employers, such as Commander Vex, who demonstrates both military precision and the particular psychological profile of someone who alphabetizes their sock drawer.

**Marketplace Intelligence Operatives** - Specialized agents who appear as Convenient Information Providers in taverns and marketplaces, delivering suspiciously specific intelligence crafted to appeal to known adventurer preferences. Statistical analysis places the probability of randomly encountering precisely the information needed at approximately 0.0037%, suggesting deliberate targeting rather than coincidental helpfulness.

**Artifact Acquisition Operations** - Evidence suggests collaborative sorcerous ventures focused on specific high-value targets such as the enigmatic "Chromatic Codex," allegedly housed in the Royal Tower. Such objectives apparently justify elaborate misdirection campaigns, mistaken identity scenarios, and the deliberate entrapment of successful adventuring parties believed to be working for competing interests.

These developments represent a fundamental shift in the risk profile associated with professional tower raiding, transitioning from ad hoc defenses concentrated within individual towers to coordinated networks operating across multiple locations with shared intelligence and resources. The modern adventurer must now consider not only what awaits inside the tower but the possibility that their very selection of a target may represent the first step in an elaborate trap.

## THE ADVENTURING PROFESSION

### Classes, Classifications, and Classlessness

The modern adventuring party consists of specialized individuals who, despite possessing skills that could earn them comfortable livings in conventional society, choose instead to risk dismemberment for the promise of treasure and the certainty of psychological trauma. These brave/foolhardy individuals generally fall into the following categories:

**WARRIORS** - Individuals who have taken the concept of "hitting things until they stop moving" and elevated it to a lifestyle choice. They typically serve as the party's frontline mobile wall, equipped with more metal than the average smithy and possessing pain receptors that operate on a significant delay. Warriors come in two varieties: those who understand the concept of tactics and those who believe screaming loudly while charging constitutes a battle plan. Recent field experience suggests warriors possess unexpected utility against dimensional threats through sheer stubborn refusal to acknowledge reality's malleability, effectively "hitting reality until it reconsidered its position." New developments include specializations in structural compromise, with particular effectiveness in identifying and exploiting support pillars during hasty extractions from sorcerous strongholds.

**MAGES** - Practitioners of magical arts who, despite having access to reality-altering powers, invariably exhaust said powers precisely nineteen seconds before they become critically necessary. Their contribution to tower raids involves explaining why they can't just teleport the party to the top floor ("interdimensional resonance interference," they'll mutter, while surreptitiously checking if anyone noticed they forgot that particular spell), providing magical illumination that attracts exactly the monsters the party was trying to avoid, and occasionally turning something into a frog. Theoretical Improbability Specialists have demonstrated particular effectiveness in countering chronometric threats through scholarly debate about causal paradoxes and citation practices. Their academic portfolios have recently expanded to include the taxonomy of allegedly magical beans and socioeconomic analyses of cooperative thaumaturgical workings.

**HEALERS** - The party's walking medical kit, spiritually attuned to divine powers yet perpetually sighing at their companions' inability to avoid clearly marked traps. They possess the unique ability to simultaneously save a companion's life while delivering a lecture on proper dungeoneering safety protocols. Most develop a thousand-yard stare by their third adventure and can often be found muttering prayers that are equal parts divine supplication and exasperated commentary on their teammates' risk assessment capabilities. Recently documented adaptations include the development of offensive alchemical applications, such as Experimental Compound #37-B, which causes rapid oxidation of ferrous metals—highly effective against animated armor but with the side effect of temporarily rust-colored allies. Advanced practitioners now demonstrate disturbing enthusiasm for cataloging the physiological effects of "involuntary chemical sedation" and contribute essential components to tactical diversionary devices.

**ROGUES** - Specialists in the "don't mind me, just passing through" school of problem-solving. Their contributions include unlocking doors that weren't actually locked, disarming traps that then mysteriously re-arm when the warrior walks through, and explaining why certain items "accidentally" fell into their pockets. A good rogue prevents problems; a great rogue convinces the party that the problems they couldn't prevent were actually someone else's fault—typically the mage's. Field-experienced rogues have begun implementing "Contingency Plan 37-C," which specifically accounts for scenarios where target artifacts have been deliberately relocated by sorcerers with foresight. Recent specialization trends include enhanced skepticism toward convenient marketplace intelligence and expertise in maintenance access point infiltration for service facilities that typically override magical security.

**BATTLE MATHEMATICIANS** - Typically orcs who have rejected their cultural emphasis on headbutting in favor of more nuanced approaches to problem-solving—such as careful negotiation, strategic planning, and precisely targeted headbutting guided by trigonometric calculations. They excel at computing success probabilities with disturbing accuracy (see: the 27.3% success probability calculation for the Zarathximagius expedition), identifying optimal entry points, and explaining to warriors why running directly at the biggest monster isn't always the optimal solution. Recent advancements include precise modeling of astronomical event effects on magical defenses, particularly the 30-second vulnerability window during eclipse totality. They have expanded their analytical range to include architectural stress analysis, statistical information verification, and probability calculations for seemingly coincidental events with suspiciously convenient timing.

**BARD/WARLOCKS** - Cryptic entities with star-based intelligence and ambiguous extraplanar heritage. Their contributions range from counterfeit authorization tokens that temporarily bypass security systems to specialized mirrors that create recursive energy loops against prismatic threats. They possess concerning immunity to dimensional distortions, unsettling familiarity with cosmic horrors, and a tendency to make oddly specific predictions about imminent events that prove distressingly accurate. Field reports suggest they maintain active communication channels with stars and may have access to information networks operating outside conventional space-time. Recent observations include sensitivity to stellar reticence patterns—the uncharacteristic silence of normally gossipy celestial bodies on certain topics—and increased awareness of their disproportionate value to powerful entities, as evidenced by bounty differentials.

These diverse specialists form parties through a complex social ritual involving tavern meetings, exaggerated resumes, and mutual suspension of disbelief regarding each other's competence claims. Once formed, they develop a bond forged through shared trauma, near-death experiences, and arguments about equitable loot distribution that somehow never get fully resolved. Interdisciplinary tactics—such as combining a warrior's disco-ball transformation with a bard/warlock's specialized mirror to defeat chromatic entities—have proven surprisingly effective, suggesting enhanced teamwork potential beyond simple skill adjacency.

## MONSTERS AND OTHER INCONVENIENCES

### The Nocturnal Employment Program for Improbable Entities

The pastoral tranquility of Spellwick's countryside undergoes a remarkable transformation as the sun sets, shifting from "suitable for picturesque watercolor landscapes" to "appropriate for album covers of doom metal bands." This diurnal/nocturnal dichotomy exists because of an ancient magical pact, a cosmic zoning ordinance, or possibly just because monsters have sensitive skin—historians remain divided on this point, largely because historians who study monsters tend to become monster food.

Standard nocturnal entities include:

- Wolves that are just wolves—no magic, no sentience, no tragic backstories—just regular wolves that somehow seem disappointed at their lack of supernatural qualities
- Gelatinous cubes seeking employment opportunities beyond dungeon maintenance
- Animated skeletons performing elaborate choreographed dance numbers when they think no one is watching
- Vampires with increasingly specific dietary restrictions ("Type O negative, from someone who's eaten only organic vegetables for at least three years, and preferably with a hint of cinnamon")

Inside towers, however, monsters operate on a 24-hour schedule, unionized under the Amalgamated Federation of Dungeon Entities (Local #237). These professional hazards range from the mundane to the metaphysically perplexing:

Level 1-3: Oversized vermin, animated objects with poor attitude control, and the occasional goblin who took a wrong turn on their way to a different career path. Recent field reports have documented regiments of animated armor with distinct heraldic designs from historically significant military units, suggesting a trend toward thematic consistency in lower-level security measures.

Level 4-7: Elementals with existential crises, gargoyles suffering from impostor syndrome, and enchanted suits of armor still following instructions from owners who died centuries ago. Specialized guardians now include Chronolibrarians capable of deploying age regression fields and Prismatic Illuminators wielding chromatic barrages and weaponized craft supplies, representing an evolution in tower defense strategy toward specialized deterrence rather than generic threats.

Level 8-10: Reality-bending entities that may have once been the sorcerer's failed experiments, tax collectors transmogrified for asking too many questions, or beings from dimensions where physics is considered more of a polite suggestion than a rule. The increasing prevalence of Reality Couturiers capable of "reinventing" intruders through non-Euclidean makeovers represents a particularly concerning development, though their vulnerability to warriors who simply refuse to acknowledge dimensional constraints offers a reassuring countermeasure.

The tower's highest levels host entities beyond conventional description—creatures so bizarre that the mind conveniently edits them from memory to prevent psychological breakdown, leaving adventurers with unexplained inventory losses and new phobias they can't quite articulate. The recent discovery of support staff such as Mathilda at Zarathximagius's pinnacle level suggests a more complex operational structure than previously assumed, with non-combat personnel potentially serving crucial roles in post-raid scenarios.

### External Threat Entities: The Professional Mercenary Problem

Beyond traditional guardians stationed within towers, adventurers must now contend with coordinated external threat entities—professional forces operating under sorcerous direction but employing military precision rather than magical chaos.

**Elite Mercenary Units** - Equipped with matching black uniforms featuring small silver insignias of towers surrounded by mathematical symbols, these forces represent a concerning level of monetary investment in adventurer suppression. Their equipment typically includes enchanted restraints, communication crystals, and those distinctive boots with sound-dampening soles that are all the rage among high-end assassination guilds and particularly considerate neighbors in apartment buildings with thin floors. Led by commanders demonstrating both tactical acumen and personal connections to sorcerous employers (see: Commander Vex), these units specialize in precision operations including choreographed ambushes and captive transport to interrogation facilities.

**Marketplace Infiltrators** - Distinguished by their ability to seamlessly blend with local populations while delivering suspiciously specific intelligence designed to appeal to known adventurer preferences. Their training apparently includes extensive dossier study of target parties, allowing them to craft information tailored to individual weaknesses—whether for magical tankards, legendary weapons, or artifacts of particular academic interest. Statistical anomalies in information delivery patterns represent the primary detection method, with veteran rogues developing enhanced skepticism toward any tavern gossip that aligns too perfectly with party objectives.

**Sorcerous Collaborators** - Perhaps the most disruptive development in the monster ecosystem: sorcerers who actively coordinate their efforts rather than operating as territorial isolationists. This previously unobserved behavior pattern suggests either an evolutionary adaptation to tower raid pressures or a specific catalyst of sufficient importance to override the natural sorcerous tendency toward dramatic solitary posturing. Current evidence points toward the latter, with the Chromatic Codex representing a prize valuable enough to justify unprecedented levels of multi-sorcerer cooperation.

## A BRIEF GUIDE TO SUCCESSFUL TOWER RAIDING

### Practical Advice for the Impractically Inclined

For those considering tower raiding as either a career or a remarkably specific suicide method, the following guidelines may marginally increase your survival prospects:

1. **Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance (and Painful Petrification)**: Research your target tower thoroughly. Local tavern gossip, while typically 60% fabrication and 30% ale-induced hallucination, occasionally contains that crucial 10% of actionable intelligence that distinguishes a successful heist from becoming a cautionary statue in the sorcerer's garden. Pay particular attention to upcoming astronomical events—solar eclipses have been confirmed to create precise 30-second vulnerability windows in magical defenses, while planetary alignments may provide longer but less reliable access opportunities.

2. **Party Composition Matters**: Ensure your team balances specialized skills. A party consisting entirely of warriors might effectively solve the "monster in our way" problem but will find themselves stymied by the subsequent "now we're locked in this room because no one can pick a lock" situation. Similarly, a group composed solely of mages might possess comprehensive theoretical knowledge about every obstacle but lack the practical ability to overcome any of them without setting something important on fire—possibly themselves. Field experience suggests interdisciplinary tactics (e.g., combining alchemical compounds with frontline combat, or mirror-based reflection with prismatic transformation) prove exponentially more effective than isolated skill application.

3. **The Artifact Identification Protocol**: Not everything that glitters is worth stealing. Learn to distinguish between:
   - Actual valuable magical artifacts (typically understated in appearance)
   - Cursed items deliberately left as bait (suspiciously prominent placement)
   - The sorcerer's personal collection of magically animated miniature spoons (worth something to very specific collectors, but not worth the ensuing pursuit)
   - Load-bearing magical objects whose removal may cause dimensional collapse (identifiable by the faint hum of reality straining to maintain itself)
   - Empty containers with notes from sorcerers who relocated the artifact last week (identifiable by the smug aura and precise calligraphy)

4. **Adaptive Countertactics**: Recent field reports indicate that experienced sorcerers have begun implementing predictive countermeasures against standard tower raid procedures. Be prepared for:
   - Pre-emptive artifact relocation to secondary storage locations
   - Strategically scheduled sensory deprivation rituals during vulnerable celestial alignments
   - Specialized guardian types with thematically appropriate abilities for each tower level
   - Support staff offering consolation prizes and unexpectedly high-quality baked goods upon discovery of missing artifacts

5. **Information Source Verification**: Apply statistical analysis to marketplace intelligence, particularly when the information aligns suspiciously well with party preferences or arrives through Convenient Information Providers who appear precisely when needed. The probability of randomly encountering exactly the specific intelligence required has been calculated at approximately 0.0037%, suggesting that tavern gossip about allegedly bottomless tankards may constitute deliberate bait rather than actionable intelligence.

6. **Contingency Planning**: Always prepare for unorthodox scenarios, including but not limited to: temporary transformation into mobile disco balls, age regression to toddler form with corresponding cognitive capacity, existence as mathematical impossibilities in non-Euclidean space, and the awkward social situation of encountering tower housekeeping staff instead of the sorcerer. Field reports suggest having specialized mirrors for recursive energy loops, alchemical compounds for rapid metal oxidation, and at least one warrior willing to hit reality until it behaves properly are all valuable contingency measures.

7. **The Strategic Retreat**: Develop, communicate, and practice an exit strategy. The words "I didn't think we'd get this far" should never be uttered inside a sorcerer's tower. Remember: even the most successful adventuring parties spend approximately 30% of their tower-raiding time running away while screaming, 15% hiding in closets while holding their breath, and 10% disguised as particularly unconvincing furniture. Always factor in lingering effects such as persistent glitter contamination, which may compromise stealth capabilities for months following exposure to prismatic combatants.

8. **Regarding Sorcerer Encounters**: In the unfortunate event that you encounter the tower's proprietor, remember the Three D's of Survival:
   - Distraction: "Look behind you, an improbably specific thing you fear!"
   - Diplomacy: "We're actually from Magical Tower Inspection Services, and I must say, your violation list is concerningly long."
   - Dimension Door (or equivalent rapid exit strategy): Self-explanatory and always preferable to the above options.

9. **Structural Compromise Assessment**: If standard exit routes become unavailable, consider Strategic Load-Bearing Element Compromise—the tactical identification and exploitation of critical support structures. Recent field experience suggests the northwest corner of merged architectural structures represents the optimal target, with proper application of force creating what engineers might classify as "enthusiastic horizontal architectural revision" sufficient to facilitate rapid unplanned exits and simultaneously discourage pursuit.

10. **Technical Success Assessment**: Be prepared to rationalize mission outcomes that fail to secure the primary target but technically fulfill contractual obligations. Arguments that may help maintain professional reputation include:
   - "We successfully accessed the designated container during the vulnerability window"
   - "The contents of said container (note and certificate) were successfully retrieved"
   - "The absence of casualties represents a significant risk-reward improvement"
   - "Complimentary scones of unexpected quality constitute value-added compensation"

11. **Bounty Awareness Protocol**: Be alert to the possibility that your party has transitioned from "anonymous raiders" to "specifically targeted individuals with monetary values assigned to their capture." This scenario represents a fundamental shift in operational risk profile, necessitating enhanced marketplace vigilance, information source verification, and strategic avoidance of certain geographical regions (e.g., Middlewich) where previous encounters with hostile sorcerous alliances have occurred.

By following these guidelines, adhering to professional standards, and maintaining a robust relationship with your preferred resurrection service provider, you too can participate in the time-honored tradition of tower raiding—a profession that continues to thrive despite having one of the highest workplace fatality rates in Spellwick, second only to "Experimental Potion Taste Tester" and "Discount Dragon Dentist."
