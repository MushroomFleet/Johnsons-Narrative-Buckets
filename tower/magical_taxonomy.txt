## MAGICAL ENERGIES CLASSIFICATION

### PRIMARY ENERGY TYPES

**CONVENTIONAL MAGICAL SPECTRUM**
- Evocation: Direct energy manipulation (fire, lightning, force)
- Transmutation: Matter alteration and property manipulation
- Conjuration: Creation of matter or summoning entities
- Abjuration: Protection, warding, and defensive magics
- Divination: Information gathering and future sight
- Enchantment: Mind and emotion manipulation
- Illusion: Sensory deception and perception alteration
- Necromancy: Life force manipulation and animation of the dead

**UNCONVENTIONAL ENERGIES**
- Chronothaumaturgical Flux: Time manipulation energies, highly unstable
- Dimensional Boundary Resonance: Energies that thin walls between realities
- Probabilistic Manipulation Fields: Alters likelihood of events (luck magic)
- Reality Consensus Override: Makes local reality conform to caster's expectations temporarily
- Narrative Causality: Magic that functions exclusively according to dramatic necessity

### ENERGY INTERACTIONS

**HARMONIC AMPLIFICATION**
When certain magical energies interact constructively, producing enhanced effects:
- Fire + Air = Explosive combustion with increased area of effect
- Water + Earth = Quicksand generation with enhanced binding properties
- Time + Probability = "Convenient coincidence" field that ensures optimal timing

**DYSHARMONIC INTERFERENCE**
When magical energies interact destructively:
- Fire + Water = Steam explosion and spell cancellation
- Necromancy + Healing = Unstable semi-living state and practitioner nausea
- Reality Override + Dimensional Boundary = Spacetime hiccups and temporary physics vacation

## MAGICAL ARTIFACTS CLASSIFICATION

### BY CREATION METHOD

**INTENTIONALLY CRAFTED**
- Created through deliberate application of magical principles
- Typically stable, predictable, and serving defined purposes
- Examples: Enchanted weaponry, warding amulets, scrying mirrors

**ACCIDENTALLY FORMED**
- Created through magical accidents, often during spellcasting gone wrong
- Unpredictable effects, frequently with ironic relationship to original intent
- Examples: The Boots of Reluctant Haste (movement speed increases proportionally with the wearer's desire to stay put)

**NATURALLY OCCURRING**
- Objects that developed magical properties through environmental exposure
- Effects typically related to surrounding magical ecology
- Examples: Resonant crystals from magical convergence zones, wood from trees growing at ley line intersections

### BY CONSEQUENCE RATING

**BENEFIT-CONSEQUENCE RATIO (BCR)**
A standard metric used by the Spellwick Artifact Evaluation Board:

**BENIGN (BCR: 3.0+)**
- Magical items with effects that are overwhelmingly positive
- Side effects minimal or actually beneficial
- Examples: Self-cleaning kitchenware, minor healing baubles, accurate weather prediction devices

**COMPLEX (BCR: 1.0-2.9)**
- Magical items with significant benefits but proportional drawbacks
- Careful usage protocols recommended
- Examples: Weaponry with powerful effects but user strain, translation devices that occasionally create embarrassing mistranslations

**HAZARDOUS (BCR: 0.1-0.9)**
- Items where negative consequences outweigh benefits for most users
- Specialized training recommended before handling
- Examples: Most sorcerers' collection pieces, anything that alters fundamental forces

**CATASTROPHIC (BCR: <0.1)**
- Items capable of large-scale destruction or reality alteration
- Typically kept at tower pinnacles behind multiple security measures
- Examples: Reality-folding devices, anything described as "technically not a weapon of mass destruction according to the Mages' Convention definitions, section 5, paragraph 3"

## MAGICAL CREATURE TAXONOMY

### TOWER EMPLOYMENT CATEGORIES

**MAINTENANCE DIVISION**
- Primary Function: Upkeep of tower facilities
- Examples: Enchanted brooms, animated furniture, gelatinous cubes (janitorial services)
- Danger Level: Minimal unless provoked or improperly programmed

**SECURITY DIVISION**
- Primary Function: Unauthorized access prevention
- Examples: Animated armor, gargoyles, bound elementals
- Danger Level: Moderate, designed for capture rather than elimination

**EXECUTIVE SECURITY DIVISION**
- Primary Function: Lethal response to significant threats
- Examples: Chimeras, phase spiders, bound demons
- Danger Level: Severe, typically positioned at higher tower levels

**REALITY MAINTENANCE DIVISION**
- Primary Function: Management of unstable magical environments
- Examples: Dimensional anchors (semi-sentient), probability stabilizers, paradox absorbers
- Danger Level: Variable, often dangerous only as a side effect of function

**SPECIAL PROJECTS DIVISION**
- Primary Function: Whatever the sorcerer thinks is interesting this week
- Examples: Anything the sorcerer has accidentally or intentionally created
- Danger Level: Unpredictable, often not known even to the creator

### NOCTURNAL ENTITIES (NON-TOWER)

**STANDARD WILDLIFE**
- Ordinary animals active at night, typically disappointing tourists with their lack of magical properties
- Examples: Normal wolves, bats, owls
- Danger Level: Appropriate to natural species

**ENHANCED WILDLIFE**
- Animals with minor magical traits developed through magical environmental exposure
- Examples: Slightly glowing rabbits, speaking (but not particularly insightful) ravens
- Danger Level: Minimal, though conversations can be tediously mundane

**TRANSITIONAL ENTITIES**
- Beings that exist partially between planes or states

- Danger Level: Variable, often tied to emotional state or magical conditions

**DIMENSIONAL VISITORS**
- Entities from other planes temporarily or permanently residing in Spellwick
- Examples: Fey creatures, minor demons, planar travelers
- Danger Level: Highly variable, often proportional to how much local customs annoy them
